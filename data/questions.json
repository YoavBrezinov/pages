      },
      "answer": "For early-stage disease, management includes radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node assessment (sentinel mapping +/- pelvic lymphadenectomy depending on setting) and assessment of margins/parametria. Primary chemoradiation is preferred if bulky tumor, suspicion of parametrial involvement, nodal disease, or high likelihood of needing adjuvant chemoradiation (to avoid combined-modality morbidity). Counsel on oncologic equivalence in appropriate settings, fertility implications, sexual/urinary/bowel morbidity, lymphedema, and the added morbidity if adjuvant CRT is required after surgery.",

        "C": "What pathology features will drive adjuvant therapy decisions?"
      },
      "answer": "Standard is total hysterectomy + BSO with nodal assessment (sentinel lymph node mapping preferred in many settings) and peritoneal assessment. In severe obesity/comorbidity: optimize medically, consider minimally invasive approach if feasible, VTE prophylaxis planning, antibiotic dosing, and enhanced recovery. Adjuvant decisions depend on stage, grade, depth of invasion, LVSI, cervical stromal involvement, and nodal status (including micromets/ITCs context).",

Offer progestin therapy (LNG-IUS and/or oral progestin) ± hysteroscopic resection in selected protocols. Monitor with scheduled endometrial sampling; if no complete response by a defined interval or progression occurs, recommend definitive surgery; after childbearing, definitive hysterectomy is recommended.",

      },
      "answer": "Goal is complete macroscopic cytoreduction at interval surgery, addressing omentum/peritoneal disease ± bowel/upper abdominal procedures as needed, with documentation of residual disease. Predictors include disease distribution on imaging/laparoscopy, response to NACT, surgeon/team experience, and patient fitness. Post-op: complete planned platinum-taxane cycles; maintenance strategy depends on BRCA/HRD status and use of bevacizumab, aiming to prolong PFS.",

        "C": "What are key acute and late toxicities to counsel about?"
      },
      "answer": "Standard is external beam pelvic radiation with concurrent weekly cisplatin, followed by intracavitary/interstitial brachytherapy to deliver adequate tumor dose. Brachytherapy is critical for local control and survival; omission compromises outcomes and is not equivalent to “boosting” with EBRT alone. Counsel acute GI/GU toxicity, fatigue, skin effects; late risks include vaginal stenosis/dyspareunia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, fistula/stricture risk, and ovarian failure (if premenopausal).",
      "explanation": "Royal answers should explicitly state that brachytherapy is non-negotiable for curative intent when feasible.",

        "C": "What margin considerations and adjuvant indications are important?"
      },
      "answer": "Groin nodes are assessed because nodal status drives prognosis; SLN biopsy is appropriate in unifocal tumors with limited size and clinically negative nodes in appropriate candidates/centers; otherwise consider inguinofemoral node dissection. Aim for adequate surgical margins; adjuvant RT is considered for close/positive margins not amenable to re-excision and for nodal involvement (especially multiple nodes or extracapsular extension).",

      },
      "answer": "For AIS with positive margins and completed childbearing, recommend repeat excision to clarify extent vs proceed to simple hysterectomy depending on circumstances; ensure endocervical sampling and assess for occult invasive disease. Counsel that AIS can be multifocal with skip lesions; positive margins increase residual disease risk; follow-up needs HPV-based surveillance per protocols even after treatment.",
      "explanation": "Examiners want you to recognize skip lesions and the need to exclude invasive disease before “routine” hysterectomy.",

        "C": "What is your aim in combining chemotherapy and radiation?"
      },
      "answer": "Common strategies include systemic chemotherapy (platinum-based) with pelvic radiation in combined-modality approaches (sequencing varies). High-risk histologies and aggressive molecular subtypes generally strengthen the rationale for systemic therapy. Combining chemo and RT aims to reduce distant recurrence risk (chemo) and improve locoregional control (RT) in appropriately selected patients.",
      "explanation": "Royal answers should emphasize goals (distant vs local control) and acknowledge that sequencing can vary by guideline/center.",

        "C": "What key counselling points do you provide about expected benefit and toxicity?"
      },
      "answer": "Platinum-sensitive recurrence is relapse ≥6 months after platinum; platinum-resistant is <6 months. Platinum-sensitive disease is generally treated with platinum-based combinations ± bevacizumab depending on prior exposure/fitness; platinum-resistant is treated with non-platinum single agents, trials, and symptom-focused care. Counsel on goals (response/PFS), cumulative toxicities (neuropathy, marrow suppression), and realistic expectations.",

        "C": "How do you communicate uncertainty and evidence limitations in this area?"
      },
      "answer": "Micrometastasis is >0.2 mm to ≤2 mm; ITCs are ≤0.2 mm. In cervical cancer, nodal metastasis generally upstages and typically leads to adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation rather than further radical surgery alone. Communicate that ultrastaging detects low-volume disease; management is generally aligned with node-positive principles, while acknowledging evolving evidence and guideline-driven practice.",
      "explanation": "Royal answers should show you know the definitions, the default management direction, and how to counsel when evidence is limited.",
