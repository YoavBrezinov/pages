    <p>
      This website is an educational resource designed to support the learning
      and ongoing knowledge development of <strong>medical students, residents,
      fellows, and practicing clinicians</strong> in gynecologic oncology.
    </p>

    <p>
      The questions are structured in an open, viva-style format and are intended
      to reflect real-world clinical reasoning rather than rote memorization.
      Each case includes focused sub-questions, model answers, explanations, and
      references to established clinical frameworks and guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      This platform was created by
      <strong>Yoav Brezinov, MD MSc</strong>,
      gynecologic oncologist, as a practical tool for exam preparation,
      self-assessment, and teaching.
    </p>

    <p>
      The content is updated regularly and is designed to complement, not replace,
      formal guidelines and clinical judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
